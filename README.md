# Spinneret

Spinneret (name subject to change) is my in-development framework for building 2D games. 

Spinneret's main purpose is to be a learning project, but also should serve as an open-source option to **develop simple 2D games quickly** with a basic and extendable feature set.

There's still some basic features I'm working on before starting making games using it.

## Tasks

### Concluded

- [x] Rendering system and sprite rendering
- [x] Entity/Component system
- [x] Base camera
- [x] Base game loop (variable update delta)
- [x] Base event observer system

### Work In Progress

- [ ] Game scene system and entity hierarchy
- [ ] Improvements to update (fixed updates, interpolation)
- [ ] Fixes to event observer system

### Backlog
- [ ] Input system with callbacks and instant queries
- [ ] Collision/Physics system (Box2D integration)
- [ ] Scripting interface (Lua integration)
